# Creating Lesson Plans

The Recommendation Configurator helps you generate personalized lesson plans with multiple activities, automatically sequenced and timed with appropriate breaks between them.

> **Note**: You can also get single activity recommendations if needed; enable **"Allow Lesson Plans"** to access the full planning features.

## Creating a Lesson Plan

### Configuration Steps

1. **Duration** – Select how long your lesson has (in minutes)
2. **Age Group** – Choose your target age group
3. **Activity Format** – Select available format(s): Unplugged, Digital, Hybrid
4. **Resources** – Check which materials/devices you have available
5. **Bloom Levels** – Choose target cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
6. **Topics** – Select which computer science topics you want to cover
7. **Enable Lesson Plans** – Toggle **"Allow Lesson Plans"** to create multi-activity sequences
8. **Set Maximum Activities** – Choose how many activities to include (e.g., 2–5)
9. **Include Breaks** – Toggle **"Include Breaks"** to add automatic rest periods between activities
10. **Generate** – Click to create recommendations

### Understanding Your Results

The system generates ranked lesson plan recommendations with scores for each sequence. Each recommendation includes a **scoring breakdown** showing:
- **Age Appropriateness** – How well activities fit your grade level
- **Bloom Alignment** – Match to your cognitive goals
- **Topic Relevance** – Coverage of your selected topics
- **Duration Fit** – How well the total time matches your available period

Each category is scored on a **0-100 scale** (100 = perfect match), and the total score is calculated as a weighted average based on importance.
