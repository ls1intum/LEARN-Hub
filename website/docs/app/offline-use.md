# Offline Use and Downloads

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

**LEARNApp** always provides the most up-to-date activity information directly from its database.  
An active internet connection is therefore required to browse, search, or generate new recommendations.

Offline use of the app itself is **not possible**, as the app continuously connects to the server to ensure that all activities and recommendations reflect the latest available data.


## Steps for Downloading Materials

You can, however, download individual activities or complete recommendations as **PDF files** for offline reference — ideal for classroom use without an internet connection.

### Steps
1. Open **Plan** tab, generate recommendations and tap a recommendation.  
2. Tap **Download PDF**.  
3. The PDF file includes all relevant information:  
   - Title, topic, and category  
   - Description and source  
   - Required materials and duration  
   - Cognitive and physical activity levels (e.g., Bloom Level, Mental Effort, Physical Activity)
