# App Documentation

LEARNApp helps teachers find suitable computer science activities for their classes, create activity recommendations, and prepare material for teaching.  
This documentation explains step by step how to discover activities, create recommendations, save favorites, manage your account, and download materials for offline use.

## Overview

The user documentation is organized around typical tasks in everyday teaching:

- **Create Activity Recommendations** – Use the Recommendation Configurator to build full activity sets tailored to lesson duration, grade level, topic, and available devices.

- **Favorites & History** – Save single activities or full recommendations as favorites and access them later via the Favorites or History view.  
- **Account Management & Offline Use** – Set up an account, manage your profile data, and download recommendations as PDFs for offline use in the classroom.  

Each section contains a short introduction and a step-by-step guide from the in-app perspective.
